# Webpack generator

A webpack project template generator.

It was supposed to also work for transforming a normal project into a webpack
project, but there are some bugs for now.

## How to use it?

It is still being developed, so, for now, clone this repo and run `main.sh` from
another location to generate the directory.

Firstly, grant it executable permission:

```console
$ chmod +x /path/to/this/repo/main.sh
```

Then, you can run it

```console
$ ./path/to/this/repo/main.sh
```

To see options, use the `-h` or `--help` flags, like so:

```console
$ ./path/to/this/repo/main.sh -h
```

or

```console
$ ./path/to/this/repo/main.sh --help
```
